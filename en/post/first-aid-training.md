**First Aid Training – Club Will Cover the Cost**

The club is looking for a few members to step forward as **Club Emergency Assistants**—individuals who can provide support in the event of a medical emergency during sessions.

A **professionally run First Aid Course** is available through Emba:

- **Date:** Wednesday, 30th April  
- **Time:** 08:30 – 14:30  
- **Location:** Acropolis Restaurant, Mesogi  
- **Cost:** €50 per person *(fully covered by the club)*  
- **Certification:** Includes an official First Aid certificate  

This is a great opportunity to gain valuable skills and contribute to a safer playing environment for everyone. Trained assistants at sessions help ensure peace of mind for all members.

Anyone interested is encouraged to get in touch as soon as possible—spaces are limited.
