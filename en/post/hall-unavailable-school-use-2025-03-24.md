**The school has announced that it will be using the hall, meaning our training sessions are unfortunately canceled on Wednesday, March 26, and Thursday, March 27.**

## For Kids

We understand this may be disappointing, and we appreciate your patience. However, we have made arrangements to accommodate some of our younger members:

- **Children over the age of 9** are welcome to attend training on an alternative day, such as Monday or Tuesday (Emba) or Friday (Emba) this week or next week.
- **For the younger group (Mariana, Mila, Timur, Alexia, etc.),** we are working on scheduling a suitable replacement session and will contact parents directly with further details.

## For Adults

Regular play will resume as usual next week on **Monday and Wednesday**.

We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your cooperation. We will keep you updated on any further developments.

Thank you for your support.
