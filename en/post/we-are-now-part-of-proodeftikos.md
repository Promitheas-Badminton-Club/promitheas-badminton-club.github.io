Promitheas BC has long been part of Promitheas FC. Recently, Promitheas FC experienced a change in its board and shifted its strategic priorities.  

Fortunately, Proodeftikos—a club with roots in handball and other sports—was happy to welcome our badminton club under their umbrella. You can learn more about them here:

While our name has changed, the badminton club remains the same at its core.  

## Benefits of joining a multisport club with a handball background

- **Shared infrastructure & facilities** – Multisport clubs often have access to improved training spaces, equipment, and venues, benefiting from economies of scale, especially when facilities are municipally supported.
- **Enhanced coordination & cross-training** – Athletes training across sports like handball and badminton can develop superior footwork, balance, and agility through varied movement patterns.  
- **Stronger community & social engagement** – Badminton thrives as a social game that bridges generations and backgrounds. A larger multisport structure offers more opportunities for events, mixers, and friendly matches, boosting membership and camaraderie.
- **Better organization & growth potential** – Being part of a multisport club gives badminton access to established administrative resources—like organizing leagues, coaching programs, youth sessions, and tournaments—without starting from scratch.
