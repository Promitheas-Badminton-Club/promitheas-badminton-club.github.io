Promitheas BC manages a few ladder tournements.

- [Singles](./singles)
- [Doubles](./doubles)

> For now the ladder is not split into age or gender. This is mainly because we don't have enough members enrolled.


## Rules

1. **Player Entry**
   - Players are **automatically added** to the ladder when they play their first game.
   - New players enter the ladder at the position of the **player they defeated** in their first match. If the challenger wins, they take the defeated player's rank, and the defeated player moves down one rank.
   - If the challenger loses, the ladder remains unchanged, and they enter the bottom of the ladder.

2. **Challenges**
   - Players can challenge any other player on the ladder.
   - If the challenger wins, they move up to the position of the challenged player, and the challenged player moves down one rank.
   - If the challenger loses, the ladder remains unchanged.

3. **Match Format**
   - Matches are played in a **best-of-three** format (first to 2 game wins).
   - The score is tracked in a `x-y` format (e.g., "21-19 19-21 21-18").

4. **Ladder Reset**
   - The ladder is **reset every year**.
